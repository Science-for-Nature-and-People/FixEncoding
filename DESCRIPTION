SystemRequirements: It is likely that proper use of the functions in this package rely on system environmental variables. At a minimum, I suggest that users be working on a mac, where the default values of LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE are UTF-8. For example, running Sys.getlocale() in my RStudio sessions returns "en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8‚Äù. See http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xbd/envvar.html.
